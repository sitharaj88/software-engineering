## What Makes This Platform Unique

<CardGrid>
  <Card title="Interactive Visualizers" icon="seti:video">
    Watch algorithms come alive with step-by-step sorting visualizations, pathfinding grids, BST builders, and data structure animations — not just static diagrams.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Algorithm Racer" icon="rocket">
    Race sorting algorithms head-to-head with real performance metrics. Compare bubble sort vs quick sort on 5,000 elements and see the difference in milliseconds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Pattern Matcher" icon="magnifier">
    Describe your problem in plain English and our pattern matcher instantly identifies the right algorithmic approach — Two Pointers, Sliding Window, DP, and more.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Multi-Language Code" icon="list-format">
    Production-quality implementations in Python, JavaScript, Java, and C++ — with integrated code playground featuring syntax highlighting and simulated execution.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complexity Analyzer" icon="pencil">
    Interactive growth-rate visualizer — toggle between O(1) through O(n!) and see exactly how many operations each requires at any input size.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Knowledge Quizzes" icon="approve-check">
    Test your understanding with topic-specific quizzes featuring instant feedback, explanations, code-based questions, and progress scoring.
  </Card>
