Landing a software engineering role at a top company requires more than just knowing how to code. It demands structured preparation across multiple dimensions: algorithmic problem-solving, system design thinking, behavioral communication, and cultural alignment.

This section provides a battle-tested framework used by engineers who have successfully navigated interviews at Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Netflix, Microsoft, and dozens of other leading technology companies.

## The Software Engineering Interview Process

Most companies follow a variation of this pipeline:

```
Application --> Recruiter Screen --> Technical Phone Screen --> On-Site Loop --> Offer
   |               |                      |                       |
   |            30 min               45-60 min              4-6 rounds
   |          Non-technical         1-2 coding             Mix of all
   v           + logistics          problems               interview types

### Typical On-Site Interview Loop

| Round | Type | Duration | What They Assess |
|-------|------|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | Coding | 45-60 min | Problem-solving, data structures, algorithms |
| 2 | Coding | 45-60 min | Different pattern, complexity analysis |
| 3 | System Design | 45-60 min | Architecture, scalability, trade-offs |
| 4 | Behavioral | 45-60 min | Leadership, collaboration, conflict resolution |
| 5 | Culture Fit / Manager | 30-45 min | Team fit, career goals, motivation |

:::note
Some companies (e.g., Google) have a separate "Googleyness" round. Others (e.g., Amazon) weave Leadership Principles into every round. Research your target company's specific format before interviewing.

## Study Plan: 8-Week Interview Preparation Timeline

This plan assumes 2-3 hours of daily practice. Adjust based on your experience level and timeline.

### Phase 1: Foundation Building (Weeks 1-2)

| Day | Focus | Activities |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Mon-Tue | Arrays and Strings | Two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums |
| Wed-Thu | Hash Maps and Sets | Frequency counting, two-sum patterns, grouping |
| Fri | Linked Lists | Fast/slow pointers, reversal, merge techniques |
| Sat | Review and Practice | Solve 3-5 easy problems from the week's topics |
| Sun | Behavioral Prep | Draft 5 STAR stories from your experience |

**Goal**: Solve 15-20 easy problems. Build fluency with basic patterns.

### Phase 2: Core Patterns (Weeks 3-4)

| Day | Focus | Activities |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Mon-Tue | Trees and BST | DFS, BFS, traversals, BST properties |
| Wed-Thu | Graphs | BFS, DFS, topological sort, connected components |
| Fri | Stacks and Queues | Monotonic stack, BFS with queue, parentheses |
| Sat | Binary Search | Standard, on answer space, rotated arrays |
| Sun | Review + Behavioral | Solve 3-5 medium problems. Refine 5 more stories |

**Goal**: Solve 20-25 medium problems. Recognize patterns instantly.

### Phase 3: Advanced Techniques (Weeks 5-6)

| Day | Focus | Activities |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Mon-Tue | Dynamic Programming | 1D DP, 2D DP, knapsack, LCS, LIS |
| Wed-Thu | Backtracking | Subsets, permutations, combinations, N-Queens |
| Fri | Greedy and Intervals | Activity selection, merge intervals, scheduling |
| Sat | Heaps and Priority Queues | Top-K, merge K lists, median finding |
| Sun | System Design Intro | Study 1 design problem end-to-end |

**Goal**: Solve 15-20 medium/hard problems. Handle DP with confidence.

### Phase 4: Polish and Mock Interviews (Weeks 7-8)

| Day | Focus | Activities |
|-----|-------|-----------|
| Mon | Timed Practice | 2 medium problems in 45 minutes |
| Tue | Weak Areas | Revisit topics where you struggled |
| Wed | Mock Interview | Full coding interview simulation with a peer |
| Thu | System Design | Practice designing 1-2 systems |
| Fri | Mock Interview | Full behavioral interview simulation |
| Sat | Review All | Revisit your problem bank, review mistakes |
| Sun | Rest | Light review only. Mental preparation |

**Goal**: Consistent performance under time pressure. No surprises.

## Tips for Success

### Before the Interview

1. **Research the company** -- Understand their products, engineering blog posts, and interview format
2. **Practice on a whiteboard or shared editor** -- The environment matters; do not only practice in your IDE
3. **Mock interviews are essential** -- Practice with a friend, use Pramp, or hire a coach
4. **Sleep well** -- Cognitive performance drops significantly with poor sleep
5. **Prepare your setup** -- For virtual interviews, test your camera, microphone, and internet connection

### During the Interview

1. **Clarify before coding** -- Ask about edge cases, constraints, and expected input size
2. **Think out loud** -- The interviewer wants to see your thought process, not just the final answer
3. **Start with brute force** -- Mention the naive approach, analyze its complexity, then optimize
4. **Write clean code** -- Use descriptive variable names, modular functions, and consistent style
5. **Test your solution** -- Walk through examples manually. Check edge cases before declaring "done"

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It Hurts | What to Do Instead |
|---------|-------------|-------------------|
| Jumping into code immediately | Misses edge cases, wrong approach | Spend 5-10 min planning |
| Silent problem-solving | Interviewer cannot assess your thinking | Narrate your thought process |
| Ignoring time/space complexity | Shows incomplete understanding | State complexity after each approach |
| Not testing your code | Bugs undermine an otherwise correct solution | Trace through 2-3 examples |
| Giving up on hard problems | Signals low resilience | Break the problem down, ask for hints |
| Over-engineering | Wastes precious interview time | Start simple, optimize if time permits |

## Evaluation Criteria

Most companies assess candidates across these dimensions:

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────┐
                    │     HIRING DECISION          │
