## How to Use These Paths

1. **Check off topics** as you complete them
2. **Practice problems** after each concept
3. **Review regularly** - spaced repetition helps
4. **Time yourself** on problems as you progress
5. **Track your progress** using our built-in tracker

## Customize Your Path

Not every path fits every learner. Feel free to:
- Skip topics you're already comfortable with
- Spend more time on challenging areas
- Mix elements from different paths
- Create your own order based on your needs
