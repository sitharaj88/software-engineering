## IC vs Management Track

Most engineering organizations offer two career paths beyond senior engineer:

```
                    Individual Contributor (IC)         Management
                    ─────────────────────────          ──────────────

                    Distinguished Engineer              VP of Engineering
                           │                                  │
                    Principal Engineer                   Director of Eng
                           │                                  │
                    Staff Engineer                       Senior Eng Manager
                           │                                  │
                    Senior Engineer  ◀───────────────▶  Engineering Manager
                           │                                  │
                        Engineer                         Tech Lead (hybrid)
                           │
                    Junior Engineer
```

### IC Track Roles

| Level | Scope | Key Responsibilities |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **Senior Engineer** | Feature/component | Own technical decisions for their area, mentor juniors |
| **Staff Engineer** | Multiple teams/domain | Set technical direction, solve cross-team problems, design systems |
| **Principal Engineer** | Organization/division | Define technical strategy, drive architectural decisions at scale |
| **Distinguished Engineer** | Company-wide | Shape industry practices, represent the company technically |

### Management Track Roles

| Level | Scope | Key Responsibilities |
|-------|-------|---------------------|
| **Tech Lead** | Single team | Technical direction + some people management |
| **Engineering Manager** | Single team | People management, delivery, hiring |
| **Senior EM** | Multiple teams | Cross-team coordination, process, culture |
| **Director** | Department | Strategy, organizational design, executive alignment |
| **VP Engineering** | Engineering org | Business strategy, budget, executive leadership |

:::note[The Tech Lead Role]
The tech lead role is often a hybrid position that combines IC work with leadership responsibilities. Some organizations treat it as a temporary rotation, others as a permanent role. It is an excellent way to test whether you enjoy leadership before committing to the management track.

## Staff/Principal Engineer Roles

Staff engineers operate at a scope that spans beyond any single team. Will Larson's taxonomy identifies four common archetypes:

### The Four Archetypes

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                    Staff Engineer Archetypes              │
├──────────────┬──────────────────────────────────────────┤

### What Staff Engineers Actually Do

A typical week for a staff engineer might include:

- **Monday** — Review three technical design documents, provide feedback
- **Tuesday** — Pair with a team on a critical migration, write prototype code
- **Wednesday** — Lead architecture review meeting, write an ADR for a cross-team decision
- **Thursday** — Debug a production performance issue, mentor a senior engineer
- **Friday** — Write a technical strategy document, present at engineering all-hands

The common thread: **multiplying the effectiveness of others** while maintaining deep technical credibility.

## Tech Lead Responsibilities

The tech lead role encompasses three key areas:

### 1. Technical Direction

- Define the technical roadmap for the team
- Make or facilitate architectural decisions
- Ensure code quality through reviews and standards
- Manage technical debt strategically
- Evaluate and adopt new technologies

### 2. Project Execution

- Break down projects into milestones and tasks
- Identify risks early and create mitigation plans
- Communicate progress to stakeholders
- Unblock team members when they are stuck
- Balance speed with quality

### 3. Team Development

- Mentor engineers on technical growth
- Create opportunities for others to take on challenges
- Facilitate knowledge sharing within the team
- Advocate for the team's needs with management
- Model engineering excellence

### What Tech Leads Should NOT Do

:::caution[Anti-Patterns]
- **Hero coding** — doing all the hard work yourself instead of enabling others
- **Gatekeeping** — requiring your approval for every decision
- **Micromanaging** — dictating implementation details instead of outcomes
- **Avoiding conflict** — letting technical disagreements fester unresolved
- **Neglecting management** — treating people issues as someone else's problem

## Influence Without Authority

Most technical leadership is exercised without formal authority. You cannot mandate that people adopt your approach — you must earn their trust and convince them through evidence and empathy.

### Strategies for Influence

| Strategy | How It Works | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Build credibility** | Demonstrate deep expertise through contributions | Ship high-quality code that others learn from |
| **Write it down** | Documentation scales your influence | Write RFCs, ADRs, and technical guides |
| **Listen first** | Understand others' constraints before proposing | "What are the biggest pain points with the current system?" |
| **Find allies** | Build coalitions across teams | Partner with another tech lead to propose a shared standard |
| **Show, do not tell** | Build prototypes rather than just arguing | "I built a proof of concept — here are the results" |
| **Create shared context** | Help others see what you see | Present data, visualizations, and clear problem statements |
| **Be consistently helpful** | Accumulate social capital over time | Review others' designs, help debug issues, share knowledge |

### The Influence Pyramid

```
                    ┌─────────┐
                    │ Mandate │  (authority — rarely available)
                   ┌┴─────────┴┐
                   │  Persuade  │  (logic and data)
                  ┌┴───────────┴┐
                  │  Collaborate │  (shared ownership)
                 ┌┴─────────────┴┐
                 │   Demonstrate  │  (lead by example)
                ┌┴───────────────┴┐
                │    Build Trust   │  (foundation of all influence)
                └─────────────────┘
```

## Building Trust

Trust is the currency of technical leadership. Without it, even the best technical ideas will be ignored.

### The Trust Equation

```
                Credibility + Reliability + Intimacy
    Trust  =   ──────────────────────────────────────
                        Self-Orientation

    Credibility:     Do you know what you're talking about?
    Reliability:     Do you follow through on commitments?
    Intimacy:        Can people be vulnerable with you?
    Self-Orientation: Are you focused on yourself or on others?
                     (lower is better)
```

### Trust-Building Behaviors

**Credibility:**
- Share your reasoning, not just your conclusions
- Admit when you do not know something
- Stay current with technology through continuous learning
- Contribute meaningful code, reviews, and designs

**Reliability:**
- Do what you say you will do, when you say you will do it
- If you cannot deliver, communicate early
- Be consistent in your standards and expectations
- Show up prepared for meetings and reviews

**Intimacy:**
- Create psychological safety for honest conversation
- Have difficult conversations privately
- Respect confidences and private information
- Show genuine interest in others' growth

**Low Self-Orientation:**
- Give credit to others publicly
- Prioritize team success over individual recognition
- Ask questions rather than immediately asserting your view
- Be willing to change your mind when presented with better evidence

## Navigating Organizational Dynamics

### Stakeholder Management

```
              High Influence
                    │
         ┌──────────┼──────────┐
         │  Keep     │  Manage  │
         │  Satisfied│  Closely │
         │          │          │
Low ─────┼──────────┼──────────┼───── High Interest
Interest │          │          │
         │  Monitor │  Keep    │
         │          │  Informed │
         │          │          │
         └──────────┼──────────┘
                    │
              Low Influence
```

### Communication Patterns

| Audience | Communication Style | Frequency |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Your team** | Detailed technical discussion | Daily |
| **Peer tech leads** | Design trade-offs, shared concerns | Weekly |
| **Engineering manager** | Risks, blockers, progress, team health | Weekly 1:1 |
| **Director/VP** | Business impact, strategic alignment | Monthly/quarterly |
| **Product managers** | Feasibility, estimates, trade-offs | Per project |
| **External teams** | Integration plans, API contracts, timelines | As needed |

:::tip[Communicate at the Right Altitude]
Match your level of detail to your audience. Your team needs implementation details. Your director needs business outcomes. Learn to "zoom in and out" fluidly — it is one of the most valuable skills a tech leader can develop.
