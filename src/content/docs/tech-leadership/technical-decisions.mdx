Technical decisions shape the trajectory of software systems for years. The best technical leaders do not just make good decisions — they create **transparent, inclusive processes** that build organizational knowledge and consensus. This page covers the frameworks and practices that lead to better technical decision-making.

## Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

An **ADR** is a short document that captures an important architectural decision along with its context and consequences. ADRs create an institutional memory of *why* things are the way they are.

### Why ADRs Matter

- New team members understand the reasoning behind existing architecture
- Teams avoid re-debating settled decisions
- When context changes, teams can revisit decisions with full understanding of the original trade-offs
- Decision-making quality improves because the process forces clear thinking

### ADR Template

```markdown
# ADR-0042: Use PostgreSQL as Primary Database

## Status
Accepted (2025-01-15)

## Context
We need to choose a primary database for our new order management
system. The system requires:
- ACID transactions for financial data
- Complex queries across related entities
- Support for JSON documents for flexible metadata
- High availability and proven reliability
- Team familiarity

We considered: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, CockroachDB.

## Decision
We will use **PostgreSQL 16** as our primary database.

## Rationale
- PostgreSQL supports both relational and JSON data models,
  eliminating the need for a separate document store
- Our team has 3+ years of production PostgreSQL experience
- The JSONB type provides flexible schema for order metadata
  while maintaining query performance
- Strong ecosystem: pgvector for future ML features,
  PostGIS if we need geospatial
- Proven at our scale (millions of orders/day at similar companies)

## Alternatives Considered

### MySQL 8
- Pros: Familiar, widely used, good performance
- Cons: Weaker JSON support, less capable query planner,
  fewer advanced features (CTEs, window functions were
  added later)

### MongoDB
- Pros: Flexible schema, good developer experience
- Cons: Weaker transaction support across collections,
  team would need training, harder to maintain data
  integrity for financial records

### CockroachDB
- Pros: Distributed by default, PostgreSQL-compatible
- Cons: Higher operational complexity, higher cost,
  overkill for our current scale

## Consequences
- We accept the operational burden of managing PostgreSQL
  (backups, replication, upgrades)
- We will use Flyway for schema migrations
- We will need read replicas if read traffic exceeds
  capacity of a single node
- Team members unfamiliar with PostgreSQL-specific features
  will need training on JSONB and advanced SQL

### ADR Best Practices

| Practice | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Keep them short** | 1-2 pages maximum; nobody reads long documents |
| **Number them sequentially** | ADR-0001, ADR-0002, etc. |
| **Store them in the repo** | Version-controlled, close to the code they describe |
| **Make them immutable** | Never edit an accepted ADR; create a new one that supersedes it |
| **Include "alternatives considered"** | Shows the decision was thoughtful, not arbitrary |
| **Record the status** | Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded by ADR-XXXX |

### ADR Status Lifecycle

```
Proposed ──▶ Accepted ──▶ Deprecated
    │              │             │
    ▼              ▼             ▼
 Rejected    Superseded     (archived)
              by ADR-XXX
```

## The RFC Process

For larger, cross-team decisions, an **RFC** (Request for Comments) process provides a structured way to propose, discuss, and decide.

### RFC vs ADR

| Aspect | ADR | RFC |
|--------|-----|-----|
| **Scope** | Single team or component | Cross-team or organization-wide |
| **Length** | 1-2 pages | 3-10 pages with detailed design |
| **Audience** | Team members, future developers | Broader engineering organization |
| **Discussion** | Informal or in PR review | Formal review period with structured feedback |
| **Timeline** | Days | 1-3 weeks |

### RFC Template

```markdown
# RFC: Migrate Authentication to OAuth 2.0 / OIDC

**Author:** Jane Smith
**Reviewers:** Auth team, Platform team, Security team
**Status:** Open for comments (closes 2025-02-01)
**Created:** 2025-01-15

## Summary
Migrate our custom authentication system to an OAuth 2.0 / OpenID
Connect-based architecture using Auth0 as our identity provider.

## Motivation
- Our custom auth system has 3 known CVEs that require urgent patches
- Password reset flow has a 15% failure rate
- No support for MFA, SSO, or social login
- Auth code is maintained by a single engineer (bus factor = 1)
- SOC 2 compliance requires documented auth controls

## Detailed Design

### Architecture
[Detailed architecture diagrams and descriptions]

### Migration Plan
[Phase-by-phase migration strategy]

### API Changes
[Breaking changes, deprecation timeline]

### Security Considerations
[Threat model, token handling, session management]

## Alternatives Considered
1. Fix the existing system
2. Build our own OAuth server
3. Use Keycloak (self-hosted)
4. Use Auth0 (managed) ← proposed

## Open Questions
1. How do we handle the 30-day token migration window?
2. Should we support both old and new auth simultaneously?

## Timeline
- Phase 1 (Feb): Auth0 setup and internal service migration
- Phase 2 (Mar): Customer-facing app migration
- Phase 3 (Apr): Deprecate old auth system
```

## Evaluating Trade-offs

Every technical decision involves trade-offs. The best leaders make trade-offs explicit rather than leaving them implicit.

### Common Trade-off Dimensions

```
                Speed of Development
                       │
         ┌─────────────┼─────────────┐
         │             │             │
    Consistency ───────┼─────── Flexibility
         │             │             │
    Simplicity ────────┼─────── Power
         │             │             │
    Performance ───────┼─────── Maintainability
         │             │             │
    Control ───────────┼─────── Convenience
         │             │             │
         └─────────────┼─────────────┘
                       │
                  Long-term Cost
```

### Decision Matrix

When comparing multiple options, use a weighted decision matrix:

```
Criteria (weight)        | Option A   | Option B   | Option C
─────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────
Performance (5)          |   4 (20)   |   5 (25)   |   3 (15)
Team familiarity (4)     |   5 (20)   |   2 (8)    |   4 (16)
Maintainability (4)      |   4 (16)   |   3 (12)   |   5 (20)
Cost (3)                 |   3 (9)    |   4 (12)   |   5 (15)
Ecosystem/community (3)  |   5 (15)   |   4 (12)   |   3 (9)
Scalability (3)          |   3 (9)    |   5 (15)   |   4 (12)
─────────────────────────┼────────────┼────────────┼────────────
Total                    |     89     |     84     |     87

(Score: 1-5, weighted score in parentheses)
```

:::caution[Matrix Pitfalls]
Decision matrices are useful for structuring thinking, but they can create a false sense of objectivity. The weights and scores are still subjective. Use the matrix to facilitate discussion, not to replace judgment.
:::

### Reversible vs Irreversible Decisions

Jeff Bezos categorizes decisions as "one-way doors" and "two-way doors":

| Type | Characteristics | Approach |
|------|----------------|----------|
| **One-way door** (Type 1) | Irreversible or very costly to reverse | Careful analysis, broad input, thorough documentation |
| **Two-way door** (Type 2) | Easily reversible, low switching cost | Decide quickly, experiment, course-correct |

Examples:
- **One-way door:** Choosing a primary database, public API design, programming language for a core system
- **Two-way door:** Internal library choice, CI/CD tool, code formatting rules, feature flag decisions

:::tip[Default to Speed]
Most decisions are two-way doors. Treat them as such. The cost of slow decisions usually exceeds the cost of occasionally wrong but quickly corrected ones.
:::

## Build vs Buy

One of the most impactful decisions in software engineering is whether to build a solution in-house or adopt an existing one.

### Decision Framework

```
         Build When:                         Buy When:
         ────────────                        ──────────

         Core differentiator                 Commodity capability
         Unique requirements                 Standard requirements
         Need full control                   Vendor meets 80%+ of needs
         Strong internal expertise           Faster time to market
         Long-term cost advantage            Team should focus elsewhere
         Regulatory/compliance needs         Operational burden too high
```

### Total Cost of Ownership Comparison

```
Build Costs:                          Buy Costs:
──────────                            ──────────
Initial development     $$$           License/subscription  $$
Testing and QA          $$            Integration work      $$
Documentation           $             Customization         $
Ongoing maintenance     $$$/year      Training              $
Security patches        $$/year       Vendor lock-in risk   $$
Feature development     $$$/year      Ongoing fees          $$/year
On-call/operations      $$/year       Migration cost (exit) $$
Knowledge continuity    $/year

Total 3-year cost:     $$$$$$         Total 3-year cost:   $$$$
(often 3-5x more than estimated)      (more predictable)
```

### When Organizations Get It Wrong

| Mistake | Consequence |
|---------|-------------|
| Building when you should buy | Engineering time wasted on non-differentiating work |
| Buying when you should build | Vendor lock-in, inability to customize, hidden costs |
| Not evaluating total cost | Hidden maintenance burden for build; hidden integration cost for buy |
| "Not invented here" syndrome | Rejecting good external solutions due to ego |
| Ignoring exit costs | Locked into a vendor with no migration plan |

## Technology Radar

A **technology radar** (popularized by ThoughtWorks) helps organizations track and communicate their stance on technologies.

```
                    ┌──────────┐
                    │  ADOPT   │  Use in production, recommended
                   ┌┴──────────┴┐
                   │   TRIAL    │  Worth exploring in non-critical projects
                  ┌┴────────────┴┐
                  │   ASSESS     │  Explore to understand, not for production
                 ┌┴──────────────┴┐
                 │    HOLD        │  Do not start new projects with this
                 └────────────────┘

Quadrants:
  1. Languages & Frameworks
  2. Tools
  3. Platforms
  4. Techniques
```

### Example Technology Radar Entries

| Technology | Ring | Rationale |
|-----------|------|-----------|
| TypeScript | Adopt | Standard for all new frontend and Node.js projects |
| Rust | Trial | Evaluating for performance-critical services |
| Deno | Assess | Interesting runtime, monitoring ecosystem maturity |
| jQuery | Hold | Legacy; migrate to modern frameworks |
| PostgreSQL | Adopt | Primary database for OLTP workloads |
| GraphQL | Trial | Using in new mobile API; evaluating DX and performance |
| Microservices | Adopt | Standard architecture for new services (with caveats) |
| Monorepo (Turborepo) | Trial | Piloting with frontend team |

## Managing Technical Debt

Technical debt is the accumulated cost of shortcuts, deferred work, and evolving requirements that slow down future development.

### Types of Technical Debt

Martin Fowler's technical debt quadrant:

```
                     Deliberate                Inadvertent
              ┌─────────────────────┬─────────────────────┐
              │                     │                     │
   Prudent    │ "We know this is    │ "Now we know how    │
              │  a shortcut and     │  we should have     │
              │  will pay it back"  │  done it"           │
              │                     │                     │
              ├─────────────────────┼─────────────────────┤
              │                     │                     │
   Reckless   │ "We don't have      │ "What's layered     │
              │  time for design"   │  architecture?"     │
              │                     │                     │
              └─────────────────────┴─────────────────────┘
```

### Measuring Technical Debt

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Cycle time increase** | Time to deliver features is growing |
| **Bug rate** | Percentage of changes that introduce bugs |
| **Code churn** | Same files modified repeatedly (indicates unclear design) |
| **Dependency age** | How outdated are your dependencies |
| **Test coverage gaps** | Areas with no tests are likely to have hidden debt |
| **Developer survey** | Ask engineers: "How confident are you making changes in area X?" |

### Strategies for Managing Technical Debt

1. **Make it visible** — Track tech debt items in the backlog with estimated cost
2. **Allocate time** — Reserve 15-20 percent of sprint capacity for debt reduction
3. **Pay it incrementally** — Fix debt as you touch related code (the "Boy Scout Rule")
4. **Prioritize by impact** — Focus on debt that slows down the most teams or the most critical paths
5. **Prevent accumulation** — Code reviews, design reviews, and quality standards
6. **Communicate business impact** — "This tech debt adds 2 weeks to every feature in the payments module"

### The Tech Debt Conversation with Product

```
INEFFECTIVE:
  Engineer: "We need 3 sprints to refactor the authentication module."
  PM: "Why? It works fine."
  Engineer: "Because the code is messy."
  PM: "We have features to ship."

EFFECTIVE:
  Engineer: "The authentication module currently takes 2 weeks for
  any feature change. With a 3-sprint investment, we can reduce that
  to 3 days. Over the next year, this saves approximately 20 weeks
  of engineering time across 10 planned auth features."
  PM: "Let's schedule it for next quarter."
```

## Communicating Technical Decisions

### To Your Team

- Share the decision and rationale in a team meeting
- Publish the ADR in the repository
- Be open to questions and concerns
- Explain what changes in their day-to-day work

### To Other Teams

- Send a summary to affected teams
- Highlight any breaking changes or migration needs
- Offer support during the transition
- Set clear timelines for deprecation

### To Leadership

- Focus on business outcomes, not technical details
- Quantify the impact (cost savings, velocity improvement, risk reduction)
- Present options, not just your recommendation
- Be transparent about trade-offs and risks

:::tip[The "One-Pager" Format]
For executive communication, use a one-page document:
1. **Problem** (2 sentences)
2. **Proposed Solution** (2 sentences)
3. **Alternatives** (bullet points)
4. **Impact** (metrics)
5. **Ask** (what you need from them)
